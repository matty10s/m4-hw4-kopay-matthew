      <h2>EDM Artists 2022</h2>
      <p>This is a few examples of some of my favorite Electronic Dance Music Artists\Producers (EDM)</p>

        <h3>Illenium</h3>

        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/illeniumofficial/illenium-sueco-story-of-my?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">ILLENIUM & Sueco - Story Of My Life (feat. Trippie Redd) Soundcloud</a>

        <p>I'm a little biased because Illenium lives in Denver, Colorado where I live. <br/> Nicholas D. Miller, known professionally as Illenium, is an American musician, DJ, and record producer. He has released four studio albums, his most recent being Fallen Embers, released in July 2021. It earned Illenium his first Grammy nomination. </p>
        <p>
        The reason I like Illenium so much is his ability to create synths are expertly layered, his melodies are catchy, and he brings a sense of nostalgia through his music that I just connect with. <br/> </p>
        <p>
        Also as a bonus Illenium was enrolled in the Music & Entertainment Industry Studies (MEIS) Department at the University of Colorado Denver. His music emphasis was Recording Arts and he attended classes for two years. He made many connections in the Denver music scene while taking courses in music business, performance, and recording arts.

        <h3>Gryffin</h3>

        <br/>

        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gryffinofficial/gryffin-jason-ross-after-you?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">Gryffin and Jason Ross After You Soundcloud</a>

        <p>Dan Griffith (the artist known as Gryffin) is an L.A.-based producer Gryffin delivered two heavy-hitting singles that showcased his deeply melodic take on dance music. With both tracks built on a graceful fusion of indie and electronic elements, “Heading Home (ft. Josef Salvat)” shot to #1 on Spotify’s US and Global Viral charts, while “Whole Heart” (a collaboration with Bipolar Sunshine) hit #2 on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist. </p>
        <p>
        I saw Gryffin play at Red Rocks and his show was amazing! His melodic sense and production takes a very engineered approach. This makes sense as he studied electrical engineering at the University of Southern California where he spent much of his leisure time in his dorm room to work on music.
        </p>
        <p>
        The reason I like Gryffin so much is his ability to harmonize melodies even better than the original artist could even imagine. I'm sure Gryffin's phone is ringing off the hook these days as Musicians line up to collaborate and produce with Gryffin.
